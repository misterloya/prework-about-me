      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm still shocked that I decided to start 
        this journey as a fullstack developer. I like to
        say that I know a little bit about a lot of things!  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p> McAllen, Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing Music, Traveling, Rocket League, Darts, Tequila</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'd like to be a professional photographer. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Houston, Texas </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm interested in developing businesses. Understanding websites and applications is 
        key to branding, marketing, e-commerce, and sales for any company. I've been working in Adobe Suite for a few years now, 
        amd I've also helped build websites using Square at the company I work for as well as for private clients. 
        Now I think it's time for me to understand how to create full functioning applications and 
        websites on my own, so that I can understand the intricacies of products available to clients.   </p>
